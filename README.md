# Overview
Project completed as independent study, under mentorship. Objective of the investment advice model is to perform two-step due dilligence on a stock, both fundamental and technical analyis.

## Analysis 1: Fundamental Score of Stock
Analysis 1 employs Stanford Professor Joseph Piotroski's F-Score for evaluating the strength of a stock based on its three statements, income statement, balance sheet, and cashflow statement, 
aggregating these values into a score out of 9 for the fundamental strength of a stock.

## Analysis 2: Technical Analysis using Machine Learning
Analysis 2 employs a Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory in order to forecase stock prices based on a variety of features such as OHLCV data, moving averages, etc.
